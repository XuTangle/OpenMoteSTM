OpenMoteSTM
===========

Hello, here is the source of OpenMoteSTM board, including the, library, schematic and PCB. All of those are designed by eagle. 

We also provide a 3d model for openmotestm using sketchUp!!! You can open the openmotestm.skp file with sketchUp to see what openmotestm looks like.

Part of package/device/model came from the library of eagle and sparkfun. See here to know the detail of OpenMoteSTM:
